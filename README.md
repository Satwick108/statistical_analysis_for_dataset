# statistical_analysis_for_dataset

In this project, we analyze the Palmer Penguins dataset using Python. First, we load the data and explore key features like species, island, and flipper length. Basic statistics like mean, median, and mode are calculated, along with other metrics like variance and skewness to understand the data distribution.

Next, we perform a t-test to compare the flipper length with a hypothetical population mean. We also calculate confidence intervals to see where the true values likely fall. Additionally, we use linear regression to check the relationship between flipper length and body mass.

Finally, we visualize the data with scatter plots and regression lines to better understand the trends between variables. These visualizations help highlight patterns and make the results easier to interpret.
